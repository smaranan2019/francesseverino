            <p>

                I know this took a while but Happy Belated Birthday! (damn jokes) I've been writing this birthday letter to you for a while now but I have never managed to finish it - jokes on me. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Anyway, I hope this book can comfort you the way it did for me. It provided me with reassurance helping me out mentally and it is considered a short read with many pictures! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Ok I don't know if I told you but I express myself better in writing. Idk if this would make sense but I'll try to explain why I'm very lucky and grateful to have you as a friend. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Okay so for Chinese right ~ I had to do a presentation on my best friend. Hahaha jokes is I don't believe in best friends. Like investing your time in like 1/2 indiv and what if something goes wrong then what. From experience it sucks you know. So I don't believe in best friends I don't believe in titles prob why I can get a long with people in general. Anw right so i was quite mmm honored ~ impacted when I went to your house and your sis was like oh chels best friend is here. It made me realise oh yeah were v close. And when it came to having to do a Chinese presentation on my best friend I did one on you haha. Without your permission woops. Infront of the whole class woops.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also right I totally understand when you spend time and effort on an individual then they like Mia or just don't return or be bothered with the friendship. I totally understand. So that's prob why I don't put like 10000% effort in friendships. Like I make it a point not to initiate so much and just do enough not to be disappointed. And at the end of it all I found other friends worth spending my time on. Idk if that's the best way but that's why I appreciate people liek you even more. Like the one who initiates outings and things to do ~ basically the planner in the group. Cause I was once that and boy it was exhausting. I know you feel that sometimes so thank you for being that friend that has initiated so much
                <br>
                <br>
                And yea bruh you make me worry all the time (your tattoos) and then hopeless (your tatoos) then unbothered till you get another one then the cycle repeats HAHAHA but yes at the end of the day you're happy then you're happy ah. But I hope you start working on yourself this year ~ who knows what will happen cause I'm reminded of your like Japanese broken pot tattoo. 
                <br>
                This year I'm going work on myself. Cause I'm really hard on myself this year so I'm going to ask you to let me know what about me do you admire ~ i know we've done this over the board game but I already had this in mind to ask ppl so if you're in my list imma have to ask you to let me know so when I'm lost and can't figure out myself I have a nice reminder of who I am. That's where I'm starting with my mental health. 
                <br>
                <br>
                And if it helps imma do the same for you. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The things I admire about chelsea: 
                - she's a strong, independent woman. If she has made up her mind about it then good luck trying to change her mind  <br>
                - she does work light years ahead of you. You turn your head and the next thing you know everything is already done. Reliable, hardworking and efficient. A perfect employee in the 996 culture. <br>
                - she gives more than she receives. In her work she's always a 10000%. Like does anyone actually deserve that 10000% ? No but she gives it anyway cause she doesn't do it for you she does it for her. <br>
                - she doesn't judge people and gives them many chances - many times I've judged people and she's there as a reminder that I didn't give that person the benefit of the doubt  <br>
                - she has a lot of energy - except when you don't feed her food and bring her to pula ubin. Else she has energy I don't quite understand. I remember meeting her in toa payoh  for like habitat ~ one of the few times I met her with Lorraine. Then she's liek across the station and when she saw us like she jumped like the starfish kind. From far away Lorraine was like yep that's Chelsea. Like common where are you going to find people with such energy. They're just a joy to be around when fully charged.  <br>
                - she's a good sister. As much as stubborn or petty she may get at the end of the day she loves her sister would take the bullet for her. She doesn't like it when her sister doesn't take care  <br>
                - she makes the world a better place - cue environmental saviour <br>
                - She blames her sisters actions on herself. I mean ~ that's what a true sister does.<br>
                - really tests my salesman pitch - rip tattoo convos <br>
                - comes from a logical and honestly the logical point of view. Wah if you cannot reason or logos your way through <br>
                - she's a good friend. She takes initiative and effort to keep a friend. The effort she'd go through to prepare something for someone ~ the handmade cards. Like wah the level of detail and effort made for that. Gg whoever got that was lucky to be her friend. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Bruh I'm so proud of myself. I use to be able to write essays (not fancy but true and honest). It's be difficult recently so writing something this long is an achievement for me heu heu
                <br>
                <br>
                My hope for you as you trun 24 is to be happier, feel free-er, worry less and smile more. Cheers to more brithday and let me take a second to like accept that I'm also going to turn 24. Always great to have someone turn a lil older first before I do HAHAHAH
