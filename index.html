            <p>This is a PaaS support project. This project did not involve much coding however we were tasked with maintaining an IT solution as a support team. We deployed the application on AWS using an EC2 image and implemented auto-scaling, RDS, load balancing, a domain, and additional security measures. We simulated an IT support life cycling from change to incident to disaster management.</p>

        <h2>Beyond Tech ~ whoami?</h2>
        <p>To be honest, I'm a mixed bag of randomness. I like seeking out "adventure" and try out new things. I love traveling and have tried out solo trips to the UAE and US during my gap year (2018-2019). Though due to Covid such traveling urges have currently been put to a stop. To make up for it, I do try to get my friends to go on hikes with me around Singapore ~ lowkey tired of Pula Ubin as I've been there approximately 4 times within 1 month. Besides trekking, I do swim and cycle quite consistently.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am also a big bookworm and love reading spy and thriller books <i>(with a soft spot for romance)</i>. Authors I tend to deviate towards are James Patterson and Cecilia Ahern. I am also a big fan of movies with meaningful storylines which traverses a large range of movie genres ranging from cartoons <i>(big fan of Disney)</i> to thrillers, though horror movies are a big no-no. You can find an animation piece I did with some friends back in secondary school <a class="tp_a" href="">here</a>.
        <br>
        <br>  
        I am a keen learner and even if I do not pick up material as fast as others I make it up with time and effort. I've been described as a hustler working my way through life just as I have learned from my parents who are first-generation immigrants.
        <br>
        <br>    
        I love meeting and working with people of various ages and backgrounds and thus find it quite easy to find a pace to fit in whatever working environment I find myself in. I am an advocator and strong believer in social causes particularly in the need of having more Women in Tech.
